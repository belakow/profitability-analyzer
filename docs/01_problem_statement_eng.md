# 1. Problem Definition

## 1.1. Situation Overview

The company PE "Trans-Atlas" regularly performs cargo transportation across Ukraine and Europe (this document focuses mainly on international routes). On paper, most routes appear profitable - with a client margin of 10–15%. However, actual financial reports show zero profit or even losses on certain directions.

## 1.2. Problem

There is no transparent tool for tracking **hidden costs**, such as:
- Empty mileage (especially return trips)
- Waiting/downtime at borders or during loading
- Toll roads, bridges, tunnels
- Depreciation expenses
- Fixed costs related to office maintenance, taxes, etc.

## 1.3. Hypothesis

A systematic error exists: only **direct costs** (fuel, driver salary) are considered when calculating a trip, while **indirect or semi-variable costs**, which significantly affect the margin, are ignored.

## 1.4. Project Goal

Develop a **prototype of a “Trip Cost Calculation Module”**, which:
- Accounts for all significant expenses
- Provides an accurate picture of route profitability
- Warns the logistics manager in case of loss-making routes
- Operates at the **planning stage**, not post-factum

## 1.5. Expected Outcome

- Transparent model of “revenue – expenses – margin”
- Reduction of unprofitable trips
- Better route planning and driver workload distribution
